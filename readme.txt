TO SETUP ENVIRONMENT:

Make sure node and npm are installed.

From within the directory:
npm init -y     (the default package.json will be replaced)

npm install --save-dev electron

Now you can clone/pull the repository
Replace the original .json files in the root folder with the .json files from this repo

Now:
Within the directory, type command 
npm start


Application window should open
If this doesnt happen, ensure the package.json files are correct.



TO PUSH CHANGES:

Only add . and commit and push specific code files DO NOT DO add . as there are files too large for github in the electron installation
